This web application was built to visualize protein glycoslyation sites and sulfide bonds to illustrate patterns in their arrangement.

- Select a protein to visualize from the drop down menu located above this card. There are several example proteins for selection.

- If the current scale of the visualization is not sufficient to identify patterns , on the top right of the app bar is a sliding scale to horizontally expand the protein.

- In addition to scaling, there is also a window feature that allows users to target a specific region for visualization. This is particularily useful when scaling alone is not sufficient to seperate patterns. The window feature is located below the original visualization.
